Hey, I'm Nic 👋—a software developer obsessed with creating things from the
ground up.

I build tools and applications that solve problems I've faced—chances are,
someone else has faced them too; that's why I enjoy building in public and
sharing what I learn along the way.

My go-to language is Rust 🦀, but I love diving deep into new technologies and
exploring how things work under the hood.

## Currently Working On

- Developing tools to make studying Japanese more effective.
- Expanding my skills with new languages and technologies.
- Sharing everything I make—the product, the planning, the lessons learned.

## Projects

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> I'm currently **open to new opportunities**!
>
> If you know a team that could use a strong developer, feel free to reach out
> or pass my name along.

Here are some of the projects I've built—tools, libraries, and applications
that help make my life easier (and hopefully yours too).

- 👏 **[Clap]** - Auto-generate CLIs from function signatures in Python.
- ⛏️ **[Axiom]** - A command-line tool for managing PaperMC Minecraft servers.
- 🪐 **[Orbit]** - Quickly switch between multiple development environments.
- 🔰 **[KanjiVG to PNG]** - Convert KanjiVG SVGs into PNG stroke diagrams.
- 🍨 **[Colorize]** - Add color and style to terminal output in Python.
